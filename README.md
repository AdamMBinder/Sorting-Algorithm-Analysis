# Sorting-Algorithm-Analysis
Implemented 10 classical sorting algorithms that sort randomly generated lengths of arrays of sizes 10 - 10,000 and tracks the runtime of each.

The purpose of this project was to give myself practical experience with data structures, algorithms, and design techniques, and also to compare their empirical performance with the ones predicted by the analysis presented online.

The sorting algorithms that have been implemented were:

● Bubble Sort

● Selection Sort

● Insertion Sort

● Merge Sort

● Quick Sort

● Heap Sort

● Counting Sort

● Radix Sort

● Bucket Sort

Before each sort, an array of size 10 - 100,000 is randomly generated and the program keeps track of the clock time and number of operations each algorithm takes until the array is successfuly sorted. 
With this data, you can analyze which algorithms are suited best for various size arrays and if it matches their average time compexity.
